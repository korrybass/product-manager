#### How to start project
run ```npm install```
then ```npm start```

This will start the project.  

#### Notes

*To get a quick start I used the create-react-app as a base for this application architecture. 
*I built this using react as the framework and redux to handle data storage.  
*I added a webpack loader for sass compilation. Most styles are in scss. If they are in css its from a third party library
*Added an animation for the advanced filter search
*I used react bootstrap table for the table functionality
*Localstorage is being saved and retrieved in the index.js using the store subscribe method (as this is a best practice).
*Fun project!
